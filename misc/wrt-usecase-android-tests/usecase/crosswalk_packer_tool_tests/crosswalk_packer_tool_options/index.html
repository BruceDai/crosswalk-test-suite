   purpose: Validate if the Packaging Tool enable works well with the 'app-version', 'app-local-path', 'name', 'package', 'description', 'fullscreen', default 'icon', 'mode=embedded', 'orientation=landscape', 'target-dir' and default 'arch' options can package app on Windows host with absolute path
    <p>
      <strong>Test steps:</strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Cd into packaging tool directory in Command Prompt. Eg: "cd C:\working\Crosswalk\Crosswalk-3.32.46.0\crosswalk"</li>
      <li>Package an web app with app-version option, command like: python make_apk.py --name=xxxx --package=xxxx.xwalk.org
       --app-root=app_path --app-local-path=index.html --app-version=1.0.0 --description=YourApplicationDescription --fullscreen
       --mode=embedded --orientation=landscape --target-dir=/home/path/to/</li>
      <li>Check the webapp version</li>
      <li>Check the packaging tool folder</li>
      <li>Check the value of "android:description" in app folder/AndroidManifest.xml</li>
      <li>Check the description in variable path (mostly in app folder/res/values/string.xml)</li>
      <li>Install the apk packaged</li>
      <li>Launch the webapp</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>Expected Output:</strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>There is a “make_apk.py” file in the folder</li>
      <li>Two apks created with "x86" and "arm" arch and embedded mode in the target dir correctly</li>
      <li>The version of the webapp is 1.0.0</li>
      <li>There generated an app folder</li>
      <li>There is variable path for description</li>
      <li>The description of the webapp is: YourApplicationDescription</li>
      <li>Web app could be installed successfully</li>
      <li>Web app could be launched with fullscreen and the screen orientation is landscape</li>
