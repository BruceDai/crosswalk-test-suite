    <strong>Test steps:</strong>
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>If org.xwalk.test exists in apptools-windows-tests/tools/ directory, remove it <br/>
        Then run below commands under apptools-windows-tests/tools/ directory: <br/>
        $ node .\crosswalk-app-tools\src\crosswalk-app create org.xwalk.test --platform=windows --windows-crosswalk=<path to xwalk win zip> <br/>
        $ cd org.xwalk.test <br/>
        $ node ..\crosswalk-app-tools\src\crosswalk-app build <br/>
        Install the app <br/>
        Open Control Center->Programs panel, then search for the app, check if "Publisher" column is "org.xwalk" <br/>
        Add '"xwalk_windows_vendor": "org.example.test"' to app\manifest.json file <br/>
        $ node ..\crosswalk-app-tools\src\crosswalk-app build <br/>
        Install the app again <br/>
        Open Control Center->Programs panel, then search for the app, check if "Publisher" column is "org.example.test"
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <strong>Expected Results:</strong>
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>The "Publisher" column is from the package ID by default instead, and it is changed by adding "xwalk_windows_vendor" field to the web manifest manually</li>
  </ol>
